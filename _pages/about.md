Hi there! Iâ€™m Shuyi Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm advised by [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu). My research lies at the intersection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Operations Research (OR)**, focusing on leveraging statistical methods to solve real-world problems. I hold a Master's degree in Information Systems Management from CMU and a B.B.A in Supply Chain and Logistics Management from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen).
