Hi there! Iâ€™m Shuyi Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu). My research lies at the intersection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Operations Research (OR)**, with a focus on developing data-driven methods for real-world challenges. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Systems Management from CMU and a B.B.A. in Supply Chain and Logistics Management from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen).

Outside of research, Iâ€™m an film photography enthusiast, a casual boulderer, and a [table tennis](https://usatt.simplycompete.com/userAccount/up/187298?uai=187298&embedded=&max=20) player.

You can view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rqz1-s_Jgm0AyNlVODXk-rQ7ylQpcxXj?usp=sharing).
